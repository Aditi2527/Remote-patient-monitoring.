# Remote-patient-monitoring.
1.The field of remote healthcare is gaining momentum as the world moves towards real-time disease diagnosis and monitoring.
2.Remote healthcare includes various categories such as mobile health and telehealth, which make use of technology to track patients' health outside of traditional hospital settings. 
3.This monitoring approach offers numerous advantages such as early disease detection, continuous monitoring of patients, prevention of disease-related fatalities, reduction in hospital
admissions, access to more precise results while allowing patients to maintain their daily routine, and improved healthcare service efficiency.
4.Remote patient monitoring benefits various groups of patients including those with chronic illnesses, mobility issues, post-surgery patients, newborns, and elderly patients.
5.Remote patient monitoring is beneficial for various groups of individuals, such as patients with chronic illnesses, those with mobility limitations or disabilities, individuals recovering from surgery, 
  newborns, and elderly patients.
objectives:-
-To make analysis over the patient data available on the internet through the most common datasets available.
-To predict the factors and symptoms to identify the disease using machine learning algorithm to find relation between the symptoms to the actual disease.
-To develop a system that can effectively anticipate illnesses by analyzing the symptoms that are currently noticeable.
-To provide an informative visualized dashboard to health line workers for effective management of patient's health.
